# DIP-Tumor_Classification
A Brain Tumor Classification Project for Digital Image Processing class (ECE 6258) at Georgia Tech.

The file main_classifier.py and all others are pretty much the same except I add Low-Pass filter or HPF to the images. 
Here are the descriptions of files we have: 

original.py --> Read the images as it is, and make sure they are grayscale 
gaussian_lpf.py --> Read the images and apply gaussian low-pass filter 
gaussian_hpf.py --> Read the images and apply gaussian high-pass filter
gaussian_lpf_hpf.py --> Read the images and apply gaussian LPF and gaussian HPF after that.
