\begin{abstract}
When diagnosed at a late stage, brain cancers and tumors provide very short life expectancy and a high mortality rate because of their aggressive nature. In order to diagnose and detect the tumor on the brain at the earliest stage possible, various medical imaging techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are used. Unfortunately, the diagnosis and treatment of the tumor depends highly on the physicianâ€™s medical knowledge. Hence, many different systems have been proposed in the past decade to automatically detect brain tumors by using machine learning. One major problem with these approaches is the fact that they usually need lots of training data (MRI Scans).  

In this project, we detect brain tumors from MRI images with a limited amount of training data, around 120 images. Specifically, we use an ensemble learning approach that is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). After applying image processing techniques such as low-pass filtering to all the images, the most common prediction from different SVM classifiers is chosen for a testing image. Validation accuracies are used to select the best image processing techniques and their optimal parameters. Our experimental results suggest that the Ensemble Classifier achieves an accuracy of 87\% with low time complexity.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
